So this week (Tuesday) was the 4th annual BSides London event held at the Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall (same venue as last year). For the last 3 years I've attended the event as not only a participant but also as a crew member, helping make the event awesome (which it is every year) and making it a tradition not to see ANY of the talks.. For me BSides is more about taking part and just meeting loads of cool people rather than going to all the talks and snagging all the free stuff, well ok apart from the MWR t-shirts but they are awesome.

This year however was slightly different, a new twist on an already awesome day. Leading up to the event I was busy helping (I use the word loosely) keep the website up-to-date (oh how I hate HTML) and generally just counting down the days.

This year I had planned on **attending** one workshop on a subject very close to my heart.. **Scapy**, which was due to be run by Matt Erasmus (@undeadsecurity). However the Thursday before BSides Matt had to pull out which left a 2 hour slot in the BSides schedule free (Can you guess where this is going??).

Friday morning I get an email from Iggy (@GeekChickUK) asking if I fancied **running** the workshop instead. No my initial panic fuelled response was going to be "God no" but then I thought "Why not, what's the worse that can happen).

The next 3 days were rammed with me writing a new workshop for a group (well I was hoping at least 1) of people that would most likely either professional infosec ninja's (they are all ninja's right??) or at least be able to point out my mistakes when I made them.

On the day I think about 18 people attended my workshop, most of them laughed at my jokes and most of them (hopefully) learnt something new about how awesome Scapy is. I've just found out the online feedback form for the whole BSides London event contains questions about my workshop so I will leave judging it's success till I see those..

If nothing else it's made me want to run more workshops, not just on Scapy but on other areas as I learn them, so I just want to say a **BIG THANK YOU** to Iggy for giving me that nudge and of course all the people that attended my workshop on the day.
