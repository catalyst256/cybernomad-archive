I'm a big fan of BSides London, it was the first security conference I ever went to, and this will be my fourth year attending. The last couple of years I've been a "crew" member for the event, working in the background to help make the event what we all know and love. Last year I stepped in last-minute to run a Scapy workshop, this year I've decided to submit one, on my other favourite thing Maltego.

Below you will find a brief description of the workshop and the things that if you are planning on attending you will need to bring with you.

**Maltego Magic - Creating transforms & other stuff**

In this workshop I will teach people how to write their own Maltego transforms. Using simple to understand examples (and pictures, everyone likes pictures) I will lead the participants through the process of creating local and remote transforms using just a pen and paper (ok a laptop is needed as well).

A basic knowledge of Maltego & Python is needed but the workshop will be aimed so that anyone can benefit from the magic that is Maltego even if they haven't coded anything before.

**Requirements for the day**

- Laptop (Mac OSX, Windows or Linux)
- Python installation (2.7 or above, not version 3 though)
- The Python Requests library (sudo pip install requests)
- Maltego (CE edition is ok)
- A text editor that's Python friendly or a Python IDE (Sublime Text, PyCharm etc)
- Your imagination (borrow someone else's if necessary)

The workshop information for the day is below:

**Date**: June 3rd 2015 **Workshop**: 3 **Track No**: 2 **Duration**: 2 hours **Schedule for**: 14:00 â€“ 16:00

If you are interesting in writing Maltego transforms come along to the workshop, if you can't make it I will be wandering around the con all day so feel free to stop me and we can have a chat about Maltego Magic.
