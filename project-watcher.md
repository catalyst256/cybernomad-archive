Hello readers,

So now that sniffMyPackets is plodding along nicely I decided to start on my next Maltego/Canari love child project. This one is called **Watcher** and is essentially wireless scanning (and some other stuff) live within Maltego. The finished project will be a cross between **Kismet**/**Aircrack-ng** & **Snoopy** (the one from the guys at Sensepost not the cartoon dog).

I have literally started this project within the last week but a bit further down (at the end of the post) you will find a preview video with some of the features that are in place. The end goal is to have a Maltego machine running that will refresh the Maltego graph every 60 seconds or so (still working on that though).

For the time being **Watcher** isn't available to download not until I've got a 60% work solution with a good set of tested transforms. This time around though my code will be a mix of offensive, defensive and bit of OSint thrown in so should be a bit of something for everyone.

Now for those that might be thinking, why bother recreating (did I mention it uses Scapy) tools that already exist, well the answer is "because I want to", if you rewind back to a year ago I couldn't actually write python code so for me it's all a learning experience. I'm trying not to "re-use" other peoples code and I have emailed Glenn @ Sensepost to say that I'm writing something that is similar (in some places) to Snoopy. My intention is not to copy or steal ideas but rather write something the way I want to use (and hopefully you will) and learn as I go, but anywhere I use people's ideas/code etc. will of course be accredited to them in the source code.

So have a look at the video, tell me what you think and I will keep you updated on my progress.
