Two weeks ago I posted about my intention to write a "dummies" guide to Scapy. So here it is ["The Very Unofficial Dummies Guide to Scapy"](http://code.google.com/p/scapy-guide/downloads/list). If you have read the online version it's still worth a look as I've made it look all nice and shiny and added some additional content that wasn't in the online version.

The whole point of this guide was to write a beginner's guide for scapy, and when I say beginners I include myself. Up until I starting writing this guide I hadn't used Scapy so I've learnt as I've gone. The guide covers the basic Scapy functions and abilities, it won't make you a Scapy expert but I hope it will give you a start.

I actually really enjoyed writing this, and using Scapy and as such I intend to carry on updating the guide. I've already thought of some more things to add into the next few chapters and once I've finished studying for my Security+ exam in June I will carry on working on this guide.

I'm not expecting the guide to be perfect, I've read through it a few times now, and made changes as suggested by the people who have proof read it for me. I only ask 2 things of the people who take the time to read this guide.

1. Please provide feedback and comments, good or bad I don't mind and if you post them on this post I will make them public. It's important for me to understand if you actually find this useful and if there is anything else you want to see in it.
    
2. I'm also still looking for ideas and examples of what can be done with Scapy, both for the next release of the guide and for my own personal knowledge. So if you use Scapy in anger then let me know for what.
    

So enjoy and please share the love that is Scapy.
